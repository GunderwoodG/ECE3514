## A1: Prime Number Algorithm Efficiency
Objective: Compare the efficiency of two prime-checking algorithms by analyzing their computational complexity through modulo operation counts. Implement the algorithms and analyze their performance.
## A2: Prime Number using smart pointer
Objective: Compare the efficiency of two prime-checking algorithms by analyzing their computational complexity through modulo operation counts. Implement the algorithms and analyze their performance.
## A3: Generic in-place Array Reversal
Objective: Reversing an array (or string) means rearranging its elements so that their order is flipped — the first element becomes the last, the second becomes the second-to-last, and so on — until the entire sequence is in the opposite order.
## A4: Lower and Upper Bound for target in Sorted Array
* Lower Bound: position of the first element that is not less than the target.
* Upper Bound: position of the first element that is greater than (>) the target value
* Frequency: number of occurrences of the target value in the array
## A5: Squares of a Sorted Array O(n)
Task: O(n) Algorithm. You have been given an algorithm in .cpp that fist squares the number in O(n) and then sort the numbers in O(n log n) using library function. This algorithm has overall time complexity of O(n log n). You will write an algorithm with overall Time Complexity O(n) and compare the results with the given algorithm. The output your algorithm must match with the given algorithm.
## A6: Vector (Part 1)
You will implement a simplified, std::vector like dynamic array called dsa::Vector. This is part 1 to implement functions declared in .hpp. You will also write test cases. std::vector must not be used to implement any of these functions (No points if std::vector is used even all test cases are passed at Gradescope).
## A7: Vector (Part 2)
You have been given an algorithm in .cpp that fist squares the number in O(n) and then sort the numbers in O(n log n) using library function. This algorithm has overall time complexity of O(n log n). You will write an algorithm with overall Time Complexity O(n) and compare the results with the given algorithm. The output your algorithm must match with the given algorithm.
## A8: Linked Lists
This assignment is to implement: singly_linked.hpp, circularly_linked.hpp, doubly_linked.hpp
## A9: Stack Queue
Problem 1: Remove Adjacent Duplicates Using Stack
Problem 2: Clean String that has backspace character <
Problem 3: Find element in a Stack (using a queue) without changing the order of the elements in the stack
## A10: Tree
In this Assignment you will write LinkedBinaryTree class in the linked_binary_tree.hpp.
## A11: Priority Queue
Problem 1: Efficient File Merge Cost
Problem 2: Top $\sqrt(N)$ Selection
## A12: E-Commerce Analytics Toolkit
Module 1: Box Fitting Optimizer
Module 2: Trending Products in Carts
Module 3: Customer Loyalty Tier
Module 4: API Endpoint Tracker
